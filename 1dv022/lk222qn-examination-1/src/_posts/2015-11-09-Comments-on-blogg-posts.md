The question to be discussed as part of an examination assignment is

>How did you implements comments to blog posts?

Well the suggestion from the task specification was to use Disqus.
You go to their site and register as user, you then follow the "add disqus to your site"-link
and one is redirected to a page which has the header "Engage". There, you might think that you're
on wrong track, because you don't want to use some blog-platform called Engage, but you continue, hoping
there is some info that might be of use, to your happy surprise after registering, you end up on a page
 where you can pick and choose, code snippets for different blog platforms, I picked the "Universal Embed Code".
 
 I immediately started to edit it, and of course nothing worked, then I received a lead from a co-student to
 just let it be as is, I took his advice, and voila, add your comments below!
 
 But the truth is that it wasn't that painfree. I started scanning the web for examples and there were some.<br>
 First you read up to the point that you understand that you have to put some disqus user data in 
 <code>_config.yml</code> Then you find old examples (guess what? disqus evolves too..),
  based on more Ruby code than necessary, I tried to modify but it didn't work. Here I used an article found at
  http://vrepin.org/vr/DisqusAddComments/
  Then after many hours of testing and reading, you occasionally run into a friend with
  superior social abilities who has a tap into the sum of knowledge of all registered
  at the courses slack channel, and that guy tells you to register at disqus, and doing that you can grab
  your plugin with your user-data already written into the plugin.
  
  In retrospective, it feels strange that I didn't, though in the heat of the battle, come to the conclusion
  that I needed to register as a disqus user, I guess that the stress took the best part of me. 
  On the other hand there are free services availible, without the requirement of registration, 
  that return the content of a HTML-form that a visitor has filled in, to your email-adress written in the HTML-header, <br>
  such as http://www.olzzon.com/gratis_formular.htm <br>,
   but then again wouldn't a minimum demand be for somebody who wants commenting on his/her blog be to be able to
  block commenters and take away abusive comments?<br>
  Sometimes having a hard skin doesn't work in your favor, one cannot
  automatically relate to other peoples sensitivities.<br>
  Would I ever take away a comment from my blog? No, I don't see the purpose of
  restricting free speach, but on the other hand I've never had the misfortune to deal with spammers as a blogger.<br>
  
  Let's face the truth: I simply don't do well under pressure, one were allowed to talk to other students, but I did not make use of
  that opportunity enough. I forgot the technique, taught at a problem solving lecture at Chalmers university,
  that just posing a question, even without receiving any answer,
  often reboots your brain into a new perspective and that the brain then often manange to solve the problem
  as you are formulating your question. <br>
  
  Shifting gears:<br>
  This thing is something that you instructors of this  Webprogramming program at distance,
  should be aware of if you're not already are.
  That is, when you restrict the ability to ask questions in programming assignements,
  you are placing the student in a situation where his or hers full mental capabilities cannot come into play,
  and that students without the mental barriers of breaking rules, the rule of not talk to each other
  about the assignment at hand, will have an edge over students that are restricted by their scruples,
  even if the problem is not solved, in the communication.<br>
  The students who simply talk to each other about a problem, will come to a solution individually faster, than
  a student who has restricted herself not to ventilate anything to anybody.
  This conclusion is valid, only if the lecturer at Chalmers has scientific base behind his statement about
  the mechanics of the brain in his problem solving lecture.<br>
  Considering the likelihood of the validity of the above observation,
  maybe you shouldn't introduce examination programming assignments, which will demand every availible brain cell
  of the student, as was in examination 2 at 1dv021, 
  recognizing the fact that the student is put in an unnatural habitat as a human being.
