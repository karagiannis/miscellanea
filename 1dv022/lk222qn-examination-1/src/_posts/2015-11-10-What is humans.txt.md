The question to be discussed as part of an examination assignment is
what is <code>humans.txt</code> and how have you configure it for your site?

<code>humans.txt</code> is a play of words, or play of concept, if you like, with <code>robots.txt</code>
which is an instruction to dedicated web-scripts, so called robots, to ignore the whole or certain parts of your site.

The people behind this, who can be found at http://humanstxt.org/, wants you to submit information
about yourself, about the tools you have used, about your twitter id, about your e-mail adress, if you like
in a file named humans.txt and place it at the root folder of your site.
The arguments they propose for this to come into reality,
the arguments they believe might have an appeal is "because we are humans and not robots".
But guess what trendies, the evil people who run this world, would never hesitate killing you,
regardless of your objections, and they are most likely trying to poison you and your loved ones,
at this very moment. <br>


Well, just to pass this course, I went a head and did just that, which I never would do otherwise,
that is to give up information about myself without receiving anything in return, just for the sake of it.
But, on the other hand, I haven't broken this principle, because, the return I am expecting,
is to pass, and add this course to my CV.

Without further ado, here is my content of humans.txt
